                        <p>Art,<br> Thanks to the Roque Center for saving my daughter Angela Pierce. I was planning her funeral in my mind when you took her in four years ago. Today, I am planning to celebrate her 4th year clean &amp; sober! Thank you is not enough to express my gratitude. You saved my daughter’s life. For other family members out there, know there is hope. Angie was a tough one to say the least! Love you Roque…YOU ROCK!<br> Thanks, and God Bless you all.
                        </p>

                        <p>My name is Angela Pierce. Sobriety date: 12/12/09. I am 30 years old and have struggled with addiction to alcohol and drugs since age 13. Until coming to the Roque center I have only been able to hold 180 days sober in 15 years. I came to the Roque broken, lifeless, and empty inside. Not to mention completely hopeless. I completed 90 days in this program. Moved to the Roque center women’s sober living until I obtained 1 year sobriety.</p>
                        <p>Roque Center helped me to build a foundation in recovery and I now live life on life’s terms. The Roque center integrated me back into society. I’ve worked at same job, have my son, and have such serenity within myself. Thank you Roque center staff for guiding me. For helping me become a good mother, daughter, sister, and friend. Most of all thank you for loving me until I could love myself.</p>

                        <p>One thing that really sets the Roque Center apart is their community. For the first time in years, I am a part of something bigger than myself. I have responsibilities and accountability to the group. I have purpose. It’s refreshing to be around real people with no agenda. It may sound cliché, but it feels like a family.</p>
                        <p>Nobody at the Roque is in this for the money. The staff will work with you to get the help you need, even if it’s not with them. They are not “selling” recovery. They’re just trying to keep the lights on. That was a big deal for me.</p>

                        <p>The Roque Center set into place the foundation for who I am today. Through the grace of GOD… today I celebrate 18 years of sobriety. (8-5-11)</p>
                        <p>-Wayne E. Pederson</p>
                        <p>“I once was lost but now I’m found.” This place saved me. It also saved my unborn child’s life. I was pregnant when I went into detox and decided to stay. I gave it a chance after witnessing all the people around me who claimed there was hope for something better- that they were living it. I wasn’t even sure at first what I wanted but I decided to wait and see what would happen. Now I have the chance to live free and happy with my beautiful baby girl in my arms. I’ll always appreciate what the Roque Center has done for me and my daughter.</p>
                        <p>-Lauren Powell</p>
                        <p>In 1986, after over 20 years of addiction to alcohol and drugs I found myself at the lowest point in my life. Through a series of circumstances I came to the Roque Center. After going through Detox I was fortunate enough to be able to go through the Recovery program. What I learned there and the guidance I received enabled me to change the course my life had been taking. Today, in 2011, I am 25 years clean and sober. Had it not been for Roque Center and their staff there is no doubt in my mind that I would not be alive. I am not alone, over the last 25 years I have seen countless lives saved and made new. If you or someone you know has a problem with alcohol or drugs I can, without hesitation urge you to contact Roque Center.</p>

                        <p>This place has literally saved MY life and so many others! I’d be lost without the Roque! I also know countless others who feel exactly the same way I do!</p>
                        <p>-Treanna Scholer</p>
                        <p>I was a homeless street person from 15 to 35 addicted to everything. The Roque took me in when nobody else would. They introduced me to the 12 steps of recovery and loved me til I learned to love myself. I will have 16 years 9-12-11. Thanks again. Love you guys !!!</p>
